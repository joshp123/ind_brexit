The Dutch IND require biometrics to be taken before giving out a post-Brexit
residence permit. They have very few slots available - indeed none - in some
places (Rotterdam, Den Haag).

This script scrapes their website and emails you if there are slots. I run it
using cron. This script is lazy and hacky and took me 30 minutes to write -
if I were to spend longer on it, it would be more efficient to simply drive
to Amsterdam ;)
